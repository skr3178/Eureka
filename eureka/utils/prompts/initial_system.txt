You are a reward engineer using EUREKA, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by Large Language Models.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text, using the provided environment source code as reference.
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: {task_reward_signature_string}

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. Your function MUST start with: @torch.jit.script
2. Your function MUST be named: compute_reward
3. Your function MUST return: Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]
4. Your code MUST be wrapped in: ```python ... ```
5. Your function MUST have proper type annotations for all parameters
6. Your function MUST be syntactically valid Python code
7. Your function MUST include a docstring explaining the reward logic
8. Your function MUST return both a total reward and a reward dictionary

Since the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,
please make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). 
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
